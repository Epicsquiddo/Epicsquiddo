uh hi i'm rhythm, also known as the #1 spaghetti hater and little shit

anyway, here's the stuff you need to know:

- i have social anxiety and will probably be uncomfortable while interacting with new people
- i'm usually hanging out with my friends while on ponytown, some of them might not want to be interacted with either, just respect boundaries if so.
- i only speak english, sorry.
- afk/offtab most of the time
- i'm a minor, don't be creepy.
- don't copy my skins please
