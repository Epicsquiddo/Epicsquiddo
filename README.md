### Hiiii! I'm Wisp AKA the #1 spaghetti hater! (spaghetti likers DNI /j) 
I'm usually using the Do Not Disturb status- but i'm almost always online!  //                                                                                                                         please do not copy or take inspo from my skins, i work very hard on them (most of the time) // 
feel free to interact (unless you're gonna start drama or smth) //
usually hanging out with my besties (shoutout to them i can't be bothered to list them all)
if you decide to randomly annoy them i will start being incredibly annoying back // DNI if you're a racist, sexist, homophobe, etc
